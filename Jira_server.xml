	<!-- This is the neat part. Without exposing the docker container to make it externally accessable we can just check the header status to see
	if our information is being sent correctly from the load balancer container, the IP inside the log will appear as the host's docker IP addr.
	Meaning that we are connecting via our user defined network bridge, which means we are going through our load balancer container inside that little network.
	If we connect directly to Jira from our local host, the log should appear empty as we are not forwarding anything in the HTTP header. This is a way to make sure
	that our load balancer container is forwarding stuff correctly to the external (Jira/Tomcat) server. (Use X-Forwarded-For as just Forwarded won't work with Jira)
